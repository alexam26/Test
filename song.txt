I'm a bullet from a gun and my heart is the trigger
When I was just a kid I would dream I was bigger
If you wanna make a name, better stand and deliver
'Cause there's a price we pay, every loser and winner

Oh, can't stop me now
Oh, can't stop me now
And heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'm singing, I'm singing
Oh, can't stop me now
